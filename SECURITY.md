# Security Review of Curator Extension

## Overview

This document provides a security assessment of the Curator Extension, highlighting both addressed vulnerabilities and current security features. This review aims to provide transparency about the security measures implemented in the extension.

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Credential Storage

**Previous Issue:** Authentication credentials were stored in plain text in Chrome's local storage.

**Solution Implemented:** 
- Added encryption for stored credentials using WebCrypto API (AES-GCM)
- Implemented key derivation using PBKDF2 with a high iteration count
- Added automatic key rotation (every 30 days)
- Data is now encrypted before storage and decrypted only when needed

### 2. GitHub Personal Access Token Handling

**Previous Issue:** GitHub tokens were temporarily visible in the UI.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Token is now handled securely through the secure-storage.js module
- Tokens are stored encrypted using AES-GCM
- Token input field is more secure in the GitHub settings UI
- Clear error messages guide users when tokens expire

### 3. Content Security Policy

**Current Implementation:** The CSP has been improved but still includes necessary permissions:
- `connect-src` still allows connections to HTTP/HTTPS sites, which is required for link checking functionality
- `style-src` includes 'unsafe-inline' for Bootstrap styling
- CDN dependencies from trusted sources (jsdelivr.net and cdnjs.cloudflare.com)

## Ongoing Security Considerations

### 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection

**Current Status:** Basic message handling is implemented but could benefit from more explicit origin checks.

**Recommendation:**
- Add stricter origin validation for message handlers
- Consider implementing a message signing mechanism for sensitive operations

### 2. Host Permissions

**Current Status:** The extension requests optional host permissions for link checking.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue using optional permissions model that requests access only when needed
- Consider showing clearer permission prompts to users

### 3. Error Handling

**Current Status:** Error messages have been improved to avoid leaking sensitive information.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue to audit error handling to ensure no credentials are leaked
- Implement structured error logging that sanitizes sensitive information

### 4. Input Validation

**Current Status:** Most user inputs are now properly escaped before DOM insertion.

**Recommendation:**
- Continue to use the established escaping utilities (`esc()` function)
- Consider implementing a more comprehensive input validation library

## Best Practices for Extension Users

1. **GitHub Token Security:**
   - Create tokens with minimal required scopes (only 'repo' is needed)
   - Regularly rotate your GitHub access tokens
   - Never share your token with others

2. **Password Management:**
   - For sites requiring authentication, consider using your browser's password manager when possible
   - Regularly update the passwords stored for authenticated sites

3. **Extension Updates:**
   - Keep the extension updated to receive the latest security improvements
   - Review permission requests carefully

## Conclusion

The Curator Extension has implemented significant security improvements, particularly around credential storage and token handling. The current implementation provides a good balance between security and functionality, with credentials now protected by modern encryption standards.

While the extension has addressed the major security concerns from the previous review, users should still follow security best practices, particularly when managing GitHub tokens and site credentials.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it through the appropriate channels:

- Open an issue on the GitHub repository for non-sensitive security improvements
- For critical security issues, contact the extension maintainers directly
