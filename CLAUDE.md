# General Preferences

* Prefer semantic HTML
* Prefer modern CSS utilizing features like variables
* Graceful degradation
* Progressive enhancement
* Accessibility is extremely important. Consider it from first principles. Use ARIA roles where applicable but prefer semantic HTML. 
* Performance is part of accessibility so ensure that assets are optimized appropriately.
* If using Bootstrap, ensure use of Bootstrap 5.3+ paying special attention to color modes. Support dark mode always.
* Do not create features which rely solely on javascript unless there is no other way and identify/highlight these instances when explaining yourself. Use <noscript> to identify to the user when this happens.
